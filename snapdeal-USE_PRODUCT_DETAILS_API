This file i have created to explain my self that how to call snapdeal API (PRODUCT DETAILS API by passing the product id) 
to get the product data by passing a paramter product id.
1. First i have copied the product url from browser

https://www.snapdeal.com/product/micromax-canvas-5-lite-q463/641004781259

2. Now i have extracted the product id from above url
id=641004781259

3. Now i am calling the snaldeap API below using postman 
affiliate-feeds.snapdeal.com/feed/product?id=641004781259

Along with above url, i have to pass 3 headers
